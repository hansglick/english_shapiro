 * De quoi s'agit il? Le met gala c'est l'histoire de riches personnes qui disent à quel point ils n'aiment pas le system sous lequel ils ont propspére
 * En quelque sorte, c'est une bonne chose car ca les montre pour ce qu'ils sont une fraude.
 * Ils ne croient mm pas dans la position politique qu'ilsprennent
 * C'est juste un accessoire, comme un portefeuille si ils sont prêt à chier dessus pour aller dans une soirée mondaine pour s'acquoquiner avec d'autres celebrités
 * Ce n'est pas une croyance profonde qui guide leur pensée
 * C'est comme si Leo Bernstein s'était déguisé en black panther et affirmait qu'il était courageux de l'avoir fait

### US
 * So what is it all about? Met Gala is about rich and famous people who basically say how little they like a system under which they have grown rich and famous.
 * In some way, this is good because it exposes them for the fraud they are.
 * They do not even believe in their political stance.
 * It is just a purse, an accessory if they are willing to drop it in order to go to a cocktail party to hobnob with other famous people.
 * It is not some sort of deeply rooted belief that guide their thoughts.
 * It is as though Leo dressed up as a black and declared himself brave for doing so.

 * Ca me rappelle un article dans le ny times magazine il y a quelque temps
 * L'auteur était Tom Forb et le titre était "Radical Chic"
 * L'article montre à quel point les riches peuvent être ridicules à vouloir paraître radical et méritant
 * L'histoire se passe dans une soirée organisée chez Leo Bernstein

### US

 * It reminds me of a cover article in new york time magazine back in the days.
 * The author was XX and the title was radical chic.
 * It shows how ridiculous some rich guys could act in order to signal the world how praiseworthy they are.
 * The scene took place at Leo's party

 * Il y a quelque chose de ridicule à prétendre défier le systeme en portant des robes à des prix exorbitants
 * il y a quelque chose de ridicule à prétendre défier la patriarchie en gagnant de l'argent grâce à la patriarchie
 * Megan rapino joue à un sport que peu de gens regardent une fois tout les 4 ans quand les médias le décident
 * En plus de ça, ils se vantent de payer les impots les plus important
 * Mais une fois à la maison, ils appellent Burma le comptable et lui demande "ou je dois mettre le cash pour ne pas payer de taxe?"


### US
 * There is something ridiculous in pretending to stand up the system by wearing expensive gows
 * there is something ridiculous in pretending stand up the patriarchy by making money from the patriarchy
 * megan rapinoe plays a sport that few people look at every once in 4 years when the media decide it's important
 * Other than that, they brag about how big they pay the tax
 * but once they are at home, they call Burma the accountat and ask him where do I stash the cash so I do not pay tax?

 * C'est ce qui fait que tout ça est permis
 * Ils n'ont pas seulemnt réussi, ils ont reconnu les démons du system

 * les plus ardents capitalistes, oui
 * En résumé, leur facon de renforcer leur sens moral supérieur est de vous chier dessus
 * C'est ce qui les rend supérieur à vous
 * Ils devraient se chier dessus (peur)

### US

 * This is what makes all of this happen
 * They not only have suceeded in the system, they have recognised the evils of the system
 * It turns out that the most ardent communists in America have never lived under communism
 * while the most capitalist have
 * It comes down to the way they reinforce their own sense of moral superiority is to crap on you.
 * This makes them superior to you.
 * They shoud be quaking in their boots.
