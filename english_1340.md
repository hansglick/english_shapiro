 * on a besoin que l'administration appelle ca une crise et prenne des mesures
 * et pas seulement ici tout le long de la frontiere sud
 * le marrant dans toute cette histoire c est que l'administration biden est obligé de suivre la même politique de trump
 * les haitiens pensent que les américains sont en train de mentir quand ils leur disent de pas venir
 * il pensent que s'ils sont pris que d'une maniere ou d'une autre joe biden n'engagera aucune poursuite contre eux et qu'on les laissera entrer

## US

 * We need the administration to call it a crisis and to take actions
 * Not only here but all along the southern border
 * the funny of all of this is that biden s administration has prompted to embrace trump's immigration policies
 * according to some testimonies, haitians don't believe what americans are saying, they think they are faking when they told them not to come
 * they think if they got caught joe biden would find some sort of ways to not prosecute them and allow them in the country

#### DRAFT

catastrophe continues to mount over at the southern border
haitian migrants seeking to escape poverty and a feeling of hopelessness
scores of people waded back and forth across the rio grande
we were told a wall is completely unnecessary because there is a river there (no one would actually cross the border)
and finding as it turns out holes in the american border system
they would have 400 agents in the area by monday morning
it seems that people are crossing the river and then going back and forth across the river (many times)
it had been humiliating to them that the state of texas had actually intervene and send its own officers
they have built themselves sort of ram shackle structures using leaves and sticks in order they dont dehydrate to death
faa had attempted to ban drone footage citing lack of safety protocols
it is an attemp to stop the news from covering the event
they have drones over there for quite a while 
when they got caught, they reversed themselves
here is some of the video from underneath the bridge that was taken 
many suffering from humanitarian needs
i dont ssee her anywhere
he is slamming joe biden
not just here but all along the southern border
all of this has prompted the biden administration to embrace the same policies that trumps embraced

the us say that we are going o start flying people out of there
there was allegedly criminal activity taking place in the area where illegal immigrants staying
it was the forst i have ever seen it
it is worse than you can imagine 
the worst is yet to come
start flying around 8 flights a day
to seek asylum
more unstable than when they left in the
first place
surge = flot
withdr

all of this = tout ce merdier
that was an all time high
as of july : depuis juillet	
we dont believe you we think you are faking
hoping that joe biden would let them in 
there is nothing new uner the sun
what have changed here 
send them back
What drove him here? (If he was in chile the past 4 years?)
Could have it something to do with the advent of jeo biden
that is what happened here
they appear to have taken control
they had failed to secure the border
we have some videos of what it looks like when you fail to secure the border
a hundred of people are streaming into the usa right now
you can see the crowds of people down here

meanwhile
overpass : pont
the most ardent communist in america have never lived under communism, but the most capitalists have
praise for a person : faire son éloge
praise the capitalism : faire l'éloge du capitalisme
he is failing to protect its borders
we need the administration to take action / to call it a crisis


appeal the deicision to a higher court
you get the worst of both worlds
it turns out that when you remove sensical logical policies bad things happen
allow to apply for temporary protected status

i'll tell you what trumps administration didn t do
he did not lead to 21 year high in illegal immigration
as we ll get to in a little while he didnt have relations with france so bad
that they withdrew 
would find some sort of ways not to prosecute them and allow them 

that is why you there for
all it is her being treated as a princess
dedaigneu = dismissive of the little people
cheer for =  root for

they will force you to mask because you are not one of the special people
